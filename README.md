# MemeGen

As a part of trying to learn React and it's quirks, I made a meme generator with the help of an online course. It's quite limited. Only two text fields. Always top and bottom. So if the random meme that the API gives the user has unconventional text placement or it needs more text fields... It won't work.

## Project setup
